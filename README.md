# node-directory-setup4-Javascript
This is my first successful node_module setup for JavaScript 

I had the problem of setting up webpack since January 2020
for some reasons beyond my understanding, there was no one to help me.
I searched online and Facebook untill 14/05/2021 when I came across this video on YouTube 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LZOL65sxhU by Read Write Exercise

I was able to setup the webpack and devserver although some codes had changed since he made the video in 2019
but you can get the latest codes from the sites he visited
